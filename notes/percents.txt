// PERCENTS AND WIDTHS SECTION //

TAKE:
we want to use percents for responsive layouts to help with the many different screen sizes.
Percents are better for all screen sizes because they'll adjust according to the percentage of the screen
On the contrary, exact px & rem for layouts will be the same on an iphone mini and also on a flat screen, which is not responsive friendly
Moreover exact heights may cause overflow issues that will require a media-query, we can stay of that media-query fix by just not using it.

THOUGHT:
Think and work responsively to adapt to the different situations that you can run into.

widths:
a lot of times are not needed to be included in the child element

// HEIGHTS SECTION //

heights:
we want to avoid messing with the height of a layout because
they cause all sorts of problems
1. overflow issues

RULE OF THUMB:
if you need to change the height, don't.
the web is already responsive.
use em and rems NOT px.

INSTEAD: 
for backgrounds:
- set a padding for more backgrounds in em and rem.
